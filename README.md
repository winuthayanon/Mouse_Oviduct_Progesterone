Codes for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of data from mouse oviducts. WT and cKO data were collected from Pgrf/f (WT) or Wnt7aCre/+;Pgrf/f (cKO) at 0.5 days post coitus (dpc) another dataset was collected from C57BL6/J adult mice that were ovariectomized and treated with progesterone (P4) at 1 mg/mouse for 2 or 24 hours compared to vehicle control. The oviducts were dissected into infundibulum+ampulla (InfAmp or IA) and isthmus+UTJ (IsthUTJ or IU) regions.
